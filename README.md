# ray tracer and real-time rendering using OpenGL & GLSL
Most of my work is in  
1. projects-ray-junsukha/src/raytracer and projects-ray-junsukha/src/raytracer/camera  
2. rendering-3d/real-time-rendering/resources/shaders/ and rendering-3d/real-time-rendering/src

In this project, I used ray tracer to render given scenes into 2D images in raytracer. Then I use OpenGL to render 3D scenes in real-time in rendering-3d folder.
